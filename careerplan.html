<h1 class="hello"> Career Plan </h1>
<p>
My ultimate career goal is to become a professional <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swingtrading.asp">swing trader</a>. The course to get there is not easy though. For the most part all I need to do is practice alot and observe my errors. Many would say that trading stocks is equivelant to gambling. While this would be true for a novice investor, if you really know what you are doing it is very profitable. I have chosen to major in computer science because I like to use computers and I think that I can harness programming to my advantage while
trading stocks. The schools that I am thinking about attending are <a href="http://www.ufl.edu/">UF</a>, <a href="https://www.usf.edu/">USF</a> or <a href="https://www.fsu.edu/">FSU</a>. Mostly because the <a href="https://brightfutures.aap.org/Pages/default.aspx">BrightFutures </a>scholarships are accepted there and because they are very respectable and have good programs for computer science. UF which is my top pick requirs a minimum GPA of 2.0 but most of their freshmen class is 4.3-4.6 GPA
and an average SAT score of 1330-1460 from its attendents. I do not need to arrange any internships but im sure that having experience in my field would be very helpful so I will be working on an internship over the summer. My career path does not require graduate school. To be hired by most tech companies you will need to be certified in C Programming Language Certified Associate,C Certified Professional Programmer,C++ Certified Associate Programmer,and C++ Certified Professional Programmer, but they are not absolutely neccessary. Although I am already certified in HTML by <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> so I have already gotten a head start. For programmers your salary all depends where you work. If you land a job at a huge tech company like <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com">FaceBook</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com">Linkedin</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a> ect you are looking at a $200,000+ per year job. But most programmers make around $115,000 a year. But for me I dont plan on using my skills in a conventinal way, I want to be able to use my programming in the stock market.
